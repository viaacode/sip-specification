# meemoo Submission Information Package (SIP) Specification

{% include_relative _metadata.liquid  %}

## Abstract

The meemoo Submission Information Package (henceforth SIP) specification describes how data and metadata should be packaged when delivered to meemoo for ingest.
It serves as a generic base for content-specific profiles for the ingest of specific use-cases (e.g. a single media file with accompanying metadata, newspapers, 3D objects etc.).

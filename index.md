# meemoo Submission Information Package (SIP) Specification

{% include_relative _metadata.liquid  %}

## Abstract

The meemoo Submission Information Package (henceforth SIP) specification describes how data and metadata should be packaged when delivered to meemoo for ingest.
It can be used to create SIPs consisting of a single media file and accompanying metadata files.
Furthermore, it serves as a generic base for content-specific subprofiles for the ingest of specific use-cases (e.g. newspapers, 3D objects etc.).

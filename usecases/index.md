This section discusses some common and concrete use cases of content that is being delivered to meemoo and how they should be packaged in the meemoo SIP.
Each use case describes the directory structure and what [SIP profile]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/diginstroom/sip/1.0/profiles/index.md %}) to apply.
This includes guidance on the used metadata formats, what metadata is included, and where to put the different files.

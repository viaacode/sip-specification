The [minimal sip sample](https://github.com/viaacode/documentation/tree/master/assets/sip_samples/cbee2999-1db5-4a69-9260-f216dee75623) is created purely for illustration purposes.
It shows a minimal implementation that conforms to meemoo's SIP specification.

Meemoo investigates the creation of other SIP samples that show the implementation of the specification according to the different MUST/SHOULD/MAY requirements.
